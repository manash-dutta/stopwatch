This is a simple stopwatch with the timer and three buttons for start, pause/stop and reset the timer.
I have used vanilla CSS to style the stopwatch.
I have used vanilla JavaScript to add functionality to the stopwatch. Main functionality are the event listeners I have put on the buttons which listens for click events. 
As soon as a click event is triggered, it fires a function to either start, stop/pause or reset the timer, depending on the button on which the click event was triggered.
